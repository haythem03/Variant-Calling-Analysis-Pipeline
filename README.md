**Variant Calling Analysis Shiny Application**

This Shiny application provides a user-friendly interface to perform bioinformatics analysis tasks, including:

- **FASTQC**: Quality control of FASTQ files.
- **Trimmomatic**: Trimming of sequences based on quality thresholds.
- **BWA**: Alignment of sequence reads to a reference genome.
- **Variant Calling**: Identification of variants from BAM files using BCFtools.
- **SnpEff**: Annotation of variants using the SnpEff tool.
  
**Dependencies**
### R Packages

To run this application locally, you need to install the following R packages:

```R
install.packages(c('shiny', 'shinydashboard', 'DT'))
```

Additionally, you may need to install the `BiocManager` and `GenomicAlignments` packages if you're using other bioinformatics tools directly in the app:

```R
install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install('GenomicAlignments')
```

### External Bioinformatics Tools

You will also need the following external bioinformatics tools. These tools should be installed on your system and be accessible in the command line (i.e., available in your system's `PATH`):

- **FastQC**: For quality control of FASTQ files.

Installation Instructions
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install R**: Make sure you have R installed. If not, download and install it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

2. **Install R packages**: Open your R console and run the following commands to install the necessary R packages:

```R
install.packages(c('shiny', 'shinydashboard', 'DT'))
install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install('GenomicAlignments')
```

3. **Install external tools**: Follow the installation instructions for **FastQC**, **Trimmomatic**, **BWA**, **BCFtools**, and **SnpEff** as provided in the respective links above.

4. **Running the application**: Save the app code in an R script (e.g., `app.R`) and run the following command in your R console to launch the application:

```R
library(shiny)
runApp('path/to/your/app.R')
```

The application should open in your default web browser.

**Usage**

1. **Upload FASTQ Files**: Select FASTQ files to analyze using the 'Upload' tab. You will be able to upload files for use with FastQC, Trimmomatic, and BWA.

2. **Run FastQC**: After uploading the FASTQ files, navigate to the 'FASTQC' tab to perform quality control on the uploaded data. The app will generate a FastQC report that can be viewed directly within the interface.
