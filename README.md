# Variant-Calling-Analysis-Pipeline
Variant Calling Analysis Shiny Application

This Shiny application provides a user-friendly interface to perform bioinformatics analysis tasks, including:

FASTQC: Quality control of FASTQ files.
Trimmomatic: Trimming of sequences based on quality thresholds.
BWA: Alignment of sequence reads to a reference genome.
Variant Calling: Identification of variants from BAM files using BCFtools.
SnpEff: Annotation of variants using the SnpEff tool.
Dependencies

R Packages
To run this application locally, you need to install the following R packages:

install.packages(c('shiny', 'shinydashboard', 'DT'))
Additionally, you may need to install the BiocManager and GenomicAlignments packages if you're using other bioinformatics tools directly in the app:

install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install('GenomicAlignments')
External Bioinformatics Tools
You will also need the following external bioinformatics tools. These tools should be installed on your system and be accessible in the command line (i.e., available in your system's PATH):

FastQC: For quality control of FASTQ files. Installation guide for FastQC

Trimmomatic: For trimming sequence reads based on quality thresholds. Installation guide for Trimmomatic

BWA: For sequence alignment. Installation guide for BWA

BCFtools: For variant calling and working with VCF files. Installation guide for BCFtools

SnpEff: For variant annotation. Installation guide for SnpEff

Installation Instructions To run this application locally, follow these steps:

Install R: Make sure you have R installed. If not, download and install it from CRAN.

Install R packages: Open your R console and run the following commands to install the necessary R packages:

install.packages(c('shiny', 'shinydashboard', 'DT'))
install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install('GenomicAlignments')
Install external tools: Follow the installation instructions for FastQC, Trimmomatic, BWA, BCFtools, and SnpEff as provided in the respective links above.

Running the application: Save the app code in an R script (e.g., app.R) and run the following command in your R console to launch the application:

library(shiny)
runApp('path/to/your/app.R')
